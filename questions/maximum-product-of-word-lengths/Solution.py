"""

Given a string array words, find the maximum value of length(word[i]) * length(word[j]) where the two words do not share common letters. You may assume that each word will contain only lower case letters. If no such two words exist, return 0.
Example 1:

Input: ["abcw","baz","foo","bar","xtfn","abcdef"]
Output: 16 
Explanation: The two words can be "abcw", "xtfn".
Example 2:

Input: ["a","ab","abc","d","cd","bcd","abcd"]
Output: 4 
Explanation: The two words can be "ab", "cd".
Example 3:

Input: ["a","aa","aaa","aaaa"]
Output: 0 
Explanation: No such pair of words.

Â 
Constraints:

0 <= words.length <= 10^3
0 <= words[i].length <= 10^3
words[i] consists only of lowercase English letters.
